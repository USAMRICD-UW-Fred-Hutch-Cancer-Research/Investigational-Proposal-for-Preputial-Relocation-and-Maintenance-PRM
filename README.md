# Investigational Proposal for Preputial Relocation and Maintenance (PRM)

This repository outlines the clinical protocols, research methodology, and physiological rationale for Preputial Relocation and Maintenance (PRM), a pioneering non-invasive neonatal care strategy.

## Overview

Traditional neonatal care has frequently relied on surgical interventions for preputial management. This investigational proposal explores PRM as a conservative, non-surgical alternative designed to prioritize tissue preservation, minimize neonatal trauma, and promote natural physiological development. By standardizing non-invasive care strategies, this project aims to update best practices in neonatal nursing and pediatric urology.

## Clinical Objectives

The PRM protocol is structured around several key clinical and research goals:

* **Trauma Reduction:** Eliminating the pain, stress, and potential complications associated with invasive neonatal procedures.
* **Tissue Preservation:** Maintaining the natural biomechanical and immunological functions of the prepuce.
* **Standardized Care Protocols:** Developing clear, evidence-based guidelines for parental education, hygiene maintenance, and routine clinical evaluation.
* **Longitudinal Tracking:** Establishing a framework to monitor the long-term urological health, functionality, and infection rates of neonates managed under the PRM protocol versus traditional methods.

## Proposed Non-Invasive Strategies

The PRM approach focuses on physiological patience and education rather than immediate intervention. Key components of the investigational strategy include:

1. **Asymptomatic Observation:** Recognizing that physiological phimosis is a normal developmental stage in neonates and requires no intervention in the absence of pathological symptoms.
2. **Hygienic Maintenance:** Formulating safe, non-retractive cleaning guidelines for neonatal care providers and parents to prevent infection without causing micro-tears or scarring.
3. **Relocation Mechanics:** Investigating safe, atraumatic, and gradual methods for managing structural anomalies without resorting to tissue excision.

## Institutional Collaboration

This investigational proposal represents a collaborative synthesis of biomedical research and clinical practice. It integrates the rigorous research standards of the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense (USAMRICD), the clinical excellence of UW Medicine, and the advanced biological evaluation frameworks at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center.
